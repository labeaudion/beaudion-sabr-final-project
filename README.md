# Exploring the Connection Between Moon Phases and Weather Data to Predict Temperature 
**Project Description:**
  This project aims to investigate the relationship between the moon phases and fluctuations in weather patterns specifically focusing on temperature anomalies. By using historical weather data from varying weather stations, this project will explore whether moon phases can predict temperature anomolies. 

**Goals:**
  The main goal of this project is to develop a model capable of predicting temperature anomalies based on the moon phases and other meterological factors. Some other goals include gathering and analying past weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and possibly other meteorological factors, and building a predictive model that can assess temperature deviations using the moon phase. 

**Data Collection:**
  We will be using web scaping techniques to pull historical weather data from sources like Wunderground or NOAA. Historical moon phase information will be collected from APIs such as the US Naval Observatory or Sunrise=Sunset.org. We will be collecting lunar phases for each date and time in the weather data set. 

**Data Modeling:**
  We will be using a linear regression model to understand the relationship between moon phases and temperature deviations. We are open to exploring more modeling techniques to find one that best fits our data. 

**Data Visualization:**
  To visualize the relationship between moon phases and temperature anomalies, we plan to use a scatter plot. Once again, we're open to exploring different methods of visualization to find the best fit method for our data. 

**Test Plan:**
  Data collected from earlier periods will be used to train the model. The weather data from May to October will be used for training. Data collected in November and December will be reserved for testing to evaluate the model's predictions.
